# SNGREP is a nifty little tool that can make a VoIP Engineer's troubleshooting tasks so much easier
# While it is not intended for live monitoring on a long term basis, with a few Linux commands one
# could actually achieve that.  So the following command, when run directly from the terminal, will
# achieve the following:

# An SNGREP instance that runs for X amount of time (21600 seconds in this case), kills and restarts itself after a 
# 1 second pause (to allow a Cntrl+C breakout)(because of the while loop), and saves a pcap of the capture to
# the location specified using the -O switch.



while [ 1 ]; do timeout -k9 21600 sngrep -O "/var/log/sngrep/sngrep_capture_$(date +%F-%H-%M-%S).pcap"; sleep 1; done



# TO USE THE COMMAND ABOVE, you need to have the following in your .sngreprc file
